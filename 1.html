<img src="inside out.jpg" width="600"><br>
<p>Growing up can be a bumpy road, and it's no exception for Riley, who
is uprooted from her Midwest life when her father starts a new job
in San Francisco. Like all of us, Riley is guided by her <storng>
  emotions-Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness.</storng> The
  emotions live in Headquarters, the control center inside Riley's
  mind, where they help advise her through everyday life. As Riley
  and her emotions sturggle to adjust to a new life in San Francisco, turmoil ensues
in Headuarters. Although Joy, Riley's main and most important
emotion, tries to keep things positive, the emotions conflict on
how best to navigate a new city, house and school. </p>
